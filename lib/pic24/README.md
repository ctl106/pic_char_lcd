A support library for Microchip Pic24 MCUs* was written by my university
professors at Mississippi State University. To remove the need for anyone to
download it seperate for inclusion, I have placed the needed files in this
directory. If revisions of this driver require other parts of the library
become needed, they should be placed here as well.

The full library can be downloaded here:

*	Despite the library being named main_pic24, it does support most if not all
	versions of the Pic24 and dsPic33. A different library would be needed for
	other Pic MCUs. You can check "pic24_chip.h" to see what all chipsets
	that the library supports.
